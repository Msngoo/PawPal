# Use the appropriate port for your Arduino on the Pi (commonly /dev/ttyACM0)

# ----- YOLO Model Setup for Dog Recognition -----
# For a pretrained model, you can use one of the official YOLOv8 files (for example, "yolov8n.pt").
# Alternatively, use your custom model file such as "best.pt". Ensure the model is in the working directory.

Revert Forced Card Configuration – Instructions and Explanation

Steps Taken to Force the Card:
--------------------------------
• To force your I2S microphone to load as a fixed card, you (or a previous configuration) edited the ALSA configuration file:
    /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
• In that file, a line similar to the following was added:
    options snd_rpi_googlevoicehat_soundcard index=1
• This command tells the Linux kernel that every time it loads the "snd_rpi_googlevoicehat_soundcard" driver, it should be assigned as card 1.

Steps to Revert the Forced Card Configuration:
-----------------------------------------------
1. Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi.
2. Edit the ALSA configuration file by running:
       sudo nano /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf
3. Look for the line:
       options snd_rpi_googlevoicehat_soundcard index=1
4. Delete this line or comment it out by placing a '#' at the front.
5. Save the file (press Ctrl+O, then Enter) and exit (Ctrl+X).
6. Reboot the Pi by running:
       sudo reboot
7. After rebooting, verify the card assignment by running:
       arecord -l
   The microphone should now appear with its natural card index (for example, card 3).

Arecord Testing Step:
----------------------
Before testing, you ran:
    arecord -D plughw:3 -c2 -r 48000 -f S32_LE -t wav -V mono -v file.wav
• This command forces ALSA to record from card 3 using 2 channels at 48 kHz with 32-bit samples.
• It is useful to check that the microphone and ALSA are working correctly.
• Once the forced configuration is reverted, you should adjust your Python code’s device index (if needed) to match the natural assignment.
